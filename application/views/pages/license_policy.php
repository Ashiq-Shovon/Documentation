                        <p>A: The Purchase Code is a special type of unique identifier that is provided automatically by
                            a marketplace after a successful purchase. It can be emailed to the buyer or can be attached
                            directly to the product. Like others, Envato marketplace also provides a unique purchase
                            code to each customer on each successful transaction.</p>

                        <h4>Q: Why do we need a Purchase Code?</h4>

                        <p> A: Purchase Code is a unique identifier that is provided automatically by a marketplace
                            after a successful purchase. The purchase code is the only proof of a successful transaction
                            for digital items like software. A product without a valid purchase code is considered as
                            pirated. A pirated copy of a software can be extremely damaging to your business. Like it
                            can get hacked easily and could potentially result in data loss. Like your transaction
                            reports, users and even your system configuration data can be lost.
                            In that case, Creativeitem will not take any kind of liabilities.
